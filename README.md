Explorify is an application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) that allows users to sign into their Spotify account and view their top artists/tracks across different time periods, as well as explore music recommendations based on their listening history. Check it out here: https://explorify.streamlit.app/! 

> Due to restrictions placed on Spotify apps that are in development mode, I have to register new users manually before they can use the app. If you're interested in trying out Explorify, please reach out to me at darrenncchen@gmail.com!
